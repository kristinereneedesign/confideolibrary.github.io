<h1> Welcome to Confideo Library; a place where you can find the truth or the lie!</h1>

<p>Confideo Library is a Lie Detecting Agency that was started by Liza Trust. Back in 1993, Dr. Trust had started going to law school to become an attorney. While there, she had noticed that there seemed to be some holes in the law system when it came to truly understanding whether or not an accused person was guilty, or not guilty. After some life changing events happened, Dr. Trust decided to dedicate her life to finding the truth on how to find out if someone is truly lying. After getting the funds she needed, and approval through the state, Trust was finally able to open Confideo Library, her lie detecting agency in 1999, and search for the best way to detect a true lie. 
Confideo Library is open to anyone and everyone who wants to know the truth about a loved one, or even an accused convict. If you’re a parent with a young child who claims they “didn’t eat the chocolate in the cupboard”, or a parent of a teenager who claims they “don’t watch porn”, or if you’re in a relationship with a lover who says they “are not cheating”, or even  if you’re a cop or detective who can’t seem to tell if you’re accused convict is fessing up, you can bring them to Confideo Library (under their consent) and we will prove to the best of our ability, if they are telling the truth or lying. </p>
<h1>Practices</h1>

<p>Whether you’re, a detective, a mom, or a lover, any of these practices are open for your choosing. You can even do all three!</p>

<h1>Psychic Practices</h1>
<p>The first study here at Confideo Library is Psychic Practices. The experts here at the Psychic Center, would be reading their subjects’ energies through various tests such as palm reading, clear seeing, clear feeling, clear hearing, etc. through these tests, the Psychics would eventually come to a conclusion on whether or not their subjects were twisting the truth. Though this practice is not considered scientific as of today, experts are studying to find the science behind psychic ability.</p>
<h1>Polygraph Examining</h1>
<p>The Second Study we hold here, is Polygraph examining. Now, Most everyone knows that polygraph tests are hardly accurate. At the Polygraph Center, these polygraph professionals understand that, and are working very hard to make the infamous lie detecting machines 100% accurate. They are studying really hard and conducting extensive research constantly, as they interview their subjects.</p> 
<h1>Neurology Studies</h1>
<p>The third study under our belt, is Neurology. In the Neurology Center, would be researching their test subjects using brain scan technology. FMRI, PET, EEG, are a couple of the methods used to test if their subject is lying, by studying their brain activity while they are being interviewed. It’s true however, that even these tests are not completely accurate, which is why these Neurologists are here; to make the technology better, so that someday we can be 100% sure if a person is lying.</p> 
<h1>Activities for kids and teens</h1>
<p>If you have a child or teen who just doesn’t want to stop fibbing, get sign up for our membership and get your own Lie-brary card. You can either get a form from our brochure or you can sign up online. We can either mail you the card, or you can come get it after signing up. We will hold events and activities for grades 1 to 12 that will encourage your rebel youngster to tell the truth. We will even give them activities to practice at home to help them break that pesky lying habit.</p> 

<h1>We’re Not Perfect </h1>
<p>Even with all the technology and experts we have here at Confideo Library, we still do not have a 100% sure way of knowing if someone is lying. Because of this, we cannot verify completely with our test results if the person in question you bring to our agency is being honest or twisting the truth. However, this is why we’re here; to find that missing link which helps us determine the 100% true lies. That being said, Confideo has been deemed the best lie detecting agency in the country, with 90% accuracy in finding the true lies.</p> 

<h1>Pricing</h1>
<p>Each visit costs 25$ for an adult, and 15$ for a child unless you get a membership which will amount to 30$ a month.</p> 
<p>
You help us, as we help you! Don’t be shy to bring your loved one in for questioning. Each time you do, you help our agency reach our goal to finding the 100% lies.
